# The Belonging Collective

Accessible, needs-first community-programming platform for Kitchener-Waterloo
nonprofits (hackathon build). Members discover/attend programs via a tactile,
one-card-at-a-time UI; sign-in is the member's choice of a memorable **2-icon
key that IS the password** (`ICON_COUNT` in `app/core/icons.py` — it has been
1 and 3 before, so read it rather than assuming) or an **email + password**
(`users.auth_type`). Password accounts still hold an allocated icon set for the
unique constraint, but it is never shown.

## Layout
- `backend/` — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy. **Source of truth for the API.**
- `frontend/` — Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion. Two distinct
  surfaces: the member app (`/` is the feed, `/signup`, and the public
  per-program pages at `/events/{id}`) and the staff admin console (`/host/*`).
  They deliberately do not look alike — see below. There is no `/events` index
  route — the feed is the home page, and `/events` 307s to it.
- `vercel.json` (root) — single-origin deploy: `/api/*` → backend, `/*` → frontend.

## Run locally
```bash
# backend → http://localhost:8000
cd backend && .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# frontend → http://localhost:3000
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
`backend/.env` (gitignored) holds `DATABASE_URL` + `JWT_SECRET`. Apply the schema
with `.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head`, then seed with
`.venv/bin/python -m app.seed` (idempotent; skips if hosts exist).

**Alembic owns the schema.** Nothing creates tables on startup any more —
`create_all` only ever emitted `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so a new column
worked locally and then 500'd every query in production against the un-ALTERed
table. Model change → `alembic revision --autogenerate` → deploy → run
`upgrade head` against prod. The baseline revision is idempotent so it is safe
against the hand-provisioned Supabase database; no `alembic stamp` needed.
Frontend also has `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) and `npm run build`.
Interactive API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs. **There is no test suite,
linter, or CI** — verify changes by running the app and typecheck.

## Database (Supabase)
- Project ref `xybhshhcgdvfgryklsze`, region `aws-1-us-west-2`.
- Pooler host `aws-1-us-west-2.pooler.supabase.com` — **:5432 session** (local),
  **:6543 transaction** (serverless/Vercel). URL prefix must be `postgresql+psycopg://`.
- Auth is **custom cookie-based** (not Supabase Auth); RLS is intentionally off —
  never expose the anon key or hit the DB from the browser.

## Same-origin deploy (why it matters)
Auth cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, frontend fetches with `credentials:"include"`, so FE
and BE **must share one origin**. In prod set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api`; FastAPI
uses `settings.ROOT_PATH` (`""` local, `/api` prod).

Required prod env: `DATABASE_URL` (:6543), `JWT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECURE=true`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `ROOT_PATH=/api`.

Organizer password reset and invitations need SMTP: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`,
`SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_FROM` (plus `SMTP_STARTTLS` / `SMTP_SSL`).
**Unset means no mail is sent and the link is written to the log instead** —
right for local dev, never acceptable in production. `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` is what
the links in that mail (and in the `.ics` exports) are built from, so a wrong
value produces links nobody can open.

## Frontend architecture

### Member app
- `components/EventsView.tsx` (~900 lines) is the member feed and orchestrates
  every accessibility mode below. Its parts live in `components/member/`:
  `FeedHeader` (account + the Accessibility Tools menu), `SavedSidebar` (the
  left column — open panel or collapsed rail; its forwarded ref is the drop
  target every save animates into), `FeedFilters` (chips + sort), `FeedCard`
  (the one card, on `ui/EventSummary`) and `ListFeed` (the rows). The saved
  list overlay (`components/SavedEvents.tsx`) opens from "See Saved Events".
- **Every save path ends in `flyToDrop`** — drag the card left into the
  sidebar, ← held ~1 s (`useHold`), the Save button, voice "save" and the
  head-tracking left edge. Keyboard mirrors the screen: ↑ previous, ↓ next, ←
  hold saves; head zones are left = save, right = saved list, up/down =
  previous/next (`useHeadTracking`). A new save path should call `flyToDrop`,
  not `attend`, or it skips the animation; the toast comes from `attend`.
- **Accessibility modes are per-member toggles**, persisted on the user (`Me.tts_enabled`,
  `voice_commands_enabled`, `eye_tracking_enabled`) and loaded from `GET /auth/me`.
  Each is a hook in `lib/`: `useTextToSpeech`, `useSpeechCommands`,
  `useHeadTracking` (head-pose cursor + `CalibrationOverlay`), `useHold`
  (the ← hold). Toggling a mode PATCHes `/users/me` and flips the
  hook — keep the persisted pref and the active hook in sync.
- `lib/feed.ts` orders the feed by match score (interest == `event.category`,
  pref ∈ `accessibility_tags`). **Personalization sorts, it never filters** —
  nothing is hidden. The only things that remove cards are the filter chips in
  `FeedFilters` (FREE + `CATEGORIES`), which are the member's own explicit
  choice; "For you" (match score) vs "Soonest" (server order) is the only sort.
  Ties fall back to the server's deterministic order, so the feed never
  reshuffles between renders.
- `saved_count` is null for anonymous viewers, so `ui/GoingCount` shows "See
  who else is going" and opens sign-in (or links to `/signup?next=` on the
  server-rendered page). The feed re-reads `/events` on sign-in
  (`fetchAllEvents`) so the counts appear, and nulls them on sign-out.
- **One listing, three surfaces.** `member/EventDetails` (no hooks) draws the
  full program — summary, DETAILS, LINKS (`event.links` plus the organizer's
  `registration_url`) — for the "More information" dialog
  (`member/EventDetailModal`), the public `/events/[id]` page and the print
  preview. Each hands in its own `tools` (`member/EventTools`: Share / Print)
  and bottom `actions`. Share and Print need no backend: `ShareModal` opens a
  `mailto:` or copies text (`lib/share.ts`), `PrintPreview` is `window.print()`
  over the `.print-target` CSS. Nested dialogs work because `Modal` only
  answers Escape/Tab when it is the last `[role=dialog]` in the document, and
  the sheets portal to `document.body` — keep both if you add another.
- `components/SavedEvents.tsx` ("All Saved Events") has no fetch of its own:
  it is handed the feed's `savedEvents`, so an un-save there and the Undo on
  its toast show at once. Its dialog is named "All saved events" — the
  sidebar already owns "Saved events".
- There is no public link to a member's saved list; "Share list" is
  `mailto:`/copy of the titles and per-event URLs only. That is a privacy
  decision not yet made, not an omission.

### Admin console (`/host/*`)
- `components/AdminShell.tsx` is the chrome: resolves the session before
  rendering, then a persistent sidebar (Programs / Admins / Members).
  `components/AdminTable.tsx` holds the shared table/button/field primitives.
- Dense, squared-off, table-first — **deliberately not** the soft
  one-thing-at-a-time member idiom. Staff doing repetitive work want everything
  one click away; don't "harmonize" the two surfaces.
- Superadmin-only pages pass `requireSuperadmin` to `AdminShell`, which gates the
  page itself, not just the nav entry. The API refuses regardless.

### Shared
- All HTTP goes through the single `api()` helper in `lib/api.ts`
  (`credentials: "include"` for the auth cookie). Image uploads use raw `FormData`
  via `uploadImage()` — never force `Content-Type: application/json` on those.
  Render errors with `apiMessage(err, fallback)`; `ApiError.message` is the raw
  body, so printing it directly shows people `{"detail": …}`.

## Gotchas / conventions
- **Passwords use `bcrypt` directly — do NOT reintroduce `passlib`** (crashes on
  bcrypt ≥4.1). Hashes are standard `$2b$`.
- **The icon set is the credential** → generate with `secrets` (see
  `app/core/icons.py`), never `random`. Two ordered icons from twelve is 132
  combinations *per name*, which is why the Postgres-backed rate limiting in
  `app/core/rate_limit.py` is load-bearing rather than a nicety.
- **Icon allocation is scoped to the username**, matching the
  `uq_users_username_icons` constraint and the way sign-in resolves a member —
  name first, then credential. Searching globally would run 132 pairs out at 132
  members across all agencies and start refusing accounts for no reason.
- **Sessions are bound to the credential that opened them.** Tokens carry `cv`,
  a fingerprint of the password hash (`security.credential_fingerprint`), and
  `deps` re-checks it on every request. So re-issuing a member's icons or
  resetting an organizer's password ends the sessions opened with the old one
  instead of leaving them live for the week a token lasts. Every place that
  mints a token must pass `cred_hash`, and `/auth/me` must apply the same check
  as the API — otherwise the UI shows a signed-in app where nothing works.
- `JWT_SECRET` has no default — the app fails fast if it's unset.
- DB engine uses `NullPool` + `prepare_threshold=None` for pgbouncer compatibility.
- **Nothing is deleted; things are archived.** Events, members *and organizer
  accounts* carry `deleted_at`, un-saving flips `event_attendees.status` to `removed` rather than
  dropping the row, and the `attendees` relationships deliberately have no
  `delete-orphan` cascade. Attendance counts are what nonprofits put in grant
  applications, so they have to outlive the event and the account. Every read
  path filters `deleted_at IS NULL`; add the filter when you add a query.
- **Saving is a bookmark.** It never registers anyone and never takes a place;
  `events.capacity` is information only. `EventOut.saved_count` ("N going") is
  `null` for signed-out viewers — the public event routes withhold it.
- **Member emails are unique over live rows only** (`uq_users_email_live` on
  `lower(email)`), the same rule as `uq_hosts_email_live`.
- **`lib/accessibility.ts` is the same idea for access needs.** The slugs sit on
  both `events.accessibility_tags` and `users.accessibility_prefs`, and matching
  is string equality, so one list drives the host picker and the member picker.
  Unknown slugs still match and still render (`tagLabel` prettifies them), so a
  tag added straight to the database is not lost — the vocabulary is expected to
  grow. `free` and `no_registration` are marked `derived`: they are written from
  the cost and drop-in answers rather than offered as chips, because asking twice
  is how the two answers end up disagreeing.
- **`lib/categories.ts` `CATEGORIES` is the one canonical topic list.** The signup
  interest chips, the member topic stepper, and the host category picker all read
  it. Interest matching compares a member's interests against `event.category`,
  so a category typed by hand can never match anyone — don't reintroduce a
  free-text category input, and don't start a second list.
- The persisted field is `eye_tracking_enabled` but the hook is
  **`useHeadTracking`** (head pose, not gaze — webgazer was replaced). The column
  name is legacy; don't rename it expecting the hook to follow.

## Roles and admin tiers
- **members** — icon sign-in (`POST /auth/user`) or email + password
  (`POST /auth/signup/user`, `POST /auth/login/user`), the `/` + `/events`
  experience.
- **admins** — hosts with `is_admin = false`. Create and manage only their own
  programs.
- **superadmins** — hosts with `is_admin = true`. Manage any program, plus member
  accounts and other admin accounts. `require_admin` in `app/api/deps.py` gates
  these, and it reads `is_admin` from the DB, not the token.

**There is no host signup route.** It existed and was open to the internet;
superadmins now create organizer accounts via `POST /hosts` or by issuing an
invitation (`/invites`), and `/host` is sign-in only. Don't add one back.

## Account recovery
Neither door can be recovered the way a normal login would be, and they work
differently from each other:
- **Members** have no "forgot password" flow — icon accounts have no address,
  and password accounts don't get one either. Recovery for both is a superadmin
  re-issuing the key (`POST /users/{id}/reset-key`) and reading it out; a
  password account is converted to an icon account (its email is released).
  The console's members table lists every key. On the member side, the
  sign-in conflict offers "I forgot my icons" rather than dead-ending, since the
  alternatives ("try again", "I'm new") both fail the member who genuinely can't
  remember — the second by stranding the account they own.
- **Organizers** reset by email (`/auth/host/forgot` → `/auth/host/reset`),
  single-use and expiring in an hour. `forgot` answers identically whether or
  not the address has an account, so it can't be used to enumerate which
  agencies are on the platform — keep it that way, including on the error paths.
  This exists because the sole superadmin previously had no way back in at all.

Two invariants worth knowing before touching `app/api/routes/hosts.py`:
- **Removing an admin archives the account and its programs.** `Host.events`
  cascades `delete-orphan`, so a plain `db.delete(host)` would destroy programs
  members have already saved. It used to reassign them to the acting superadmin
  instead, which kept them visible but filed one agency's work under another's
  name — so both now get `deleted_at` and the programs stay attributed to the
  organization that ran them. `hosts.email` is unique over live rows only
  (`uq_hosts_email_live`), so an archived account releases its address and an
  agency that left can be invited back under it.
- **A superadmin can't demote or delete themselves.** That refusal is what keeps
  at least one superadmin in the system — you can only remove someone else's
  rights, so your own survive.

## Status
**https://the-belonging-collective.vercel.app is live and public.** Both of the blockers this
section used to list are fixed, and the fixes were dashboard settings, so
nothing in the repo records them — verify against the deployment, not the code:

- SSO protection is scoped to **preview** deployments only, so production is
  reachable without a Vercel login. Preview URLs still 302 to the login wall;
  that is deliberate, don't share one with the agencies.
- `DATABASE_URL` on Vercel uses the **:6543 transaction** pooler, so the
  serverless backend reaches Supabase. `/api/health`, `/api/events` and the
  server-rendered `/events/{id}` all answer 200 against real data.

Re-check with `curl https://the-belonging-collective.vercel.app/api/health` before assuming
either has regressed; a stale "it only runs locally" belief here has already
cost one wrong diagnosis.

**Data.** The 37 real programs from `KWHab_Event_Test_Data.xlsx` are imported as
273 dated occurrences across the six agencies (Extend-A-Family, Karis Disability
Services, WRFN, Independent Living, Developmental Services Ontario, KW
Habilitation). The earlier seeded demo programming is archived, not deleted —
it used four categories (`Advice`, `Arts`, `Hangout`, `Food`) that predate the
real taxonomy and so could never match anyone's interests. Every live event now
carries a category from `CATEGORIES`; keep it that way, and don't un-archive the
demo rows without re-filing their categories first.
