"""Failure-counting rate limits for the auth endpoints.

Every sign-in, sign-up, reset and care-link route counts failures here, so a
script can't sweep passwords against a known address, and the 409 on sign-up
can't be used to list which addresses have accounts.

Two deliberate design choices:

* **Only failures count, and a success clears that identity's counter.** A
  member who knows their password is never locked out, no matter how much noise
  someone else is making against their name. It also means the identity budget
  can be small without ever getting in a real member's way.
* **Success does NOT clear the IP counter.** Only the identity key is cleared.
  Signing in successfully proves you hold one credential; it says nothing about
  the other names being tried from the same address. Clearing the shared IP
  bucket on success would let anyone with a single valid account reset the
  sweep protection at will by logging in periodically.
* **The per-IP budget is generous.** Members frequently sign in from a shared
  facility — a community centre or a group home — so several people onboarding
  together legitimately share one address, and mistypes are expected rather
  than exceptional. A tight IP limit would lock out a whole room, which is
  exactly the population this platform exists to serve. Since the IP bucket
  only drains by expiry, it is set high enough that a real session can't reach
  it. The per-identity budget is what stops a targeted guess, and it stays at
  10 regardless of how much room the IP budget has. The IP limit's only job is
  to make sweeping across many addresses at once impractical.
