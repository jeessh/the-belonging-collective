"""Upcoming demo programming, for looking at the member feed with real shapes in it.

`app.seed` bootstraps an empty database and skips entirely once hosts exist, so
it can't top up a database that's been used. This tops up: it adds programs
dated from today forward and skips any title it already created, so running it
twice is safe.

Deliberately varied, because the feed's behaviour only shows up under variety —
every category so the topic stepper has something to step through, every
activity type, all four registration states, free and paid, dated and undated,
several organizations so the org stepper isn't a single dot.
