/**
 * Is the posting link actually a link to the posting?

 * having already been told they were being taken to the thing they wanted. For
 * someone this platform exists to help, that is where the trail goes cold.
 *
 * A warning rather than a block: some agencies genuinely have one page, and
 * refusing to accept it would mean they post no link at all, which is worse.
